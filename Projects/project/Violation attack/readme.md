## Violence Attack

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2015 (except 1993). I used different cleaning methods and prepared the clean panda version data set. Then, I used Tableau data visualization, different python libraries like numpy, seaborn and matplolib to explore data. Then I used Baysian inference to compare two populations to know if the amount of terror in one area has seen differs in a significant way than another area. At the end, I used regression model to predict number of people killed in 1993.

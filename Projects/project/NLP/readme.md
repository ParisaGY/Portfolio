## Natural Language Processing

In this project, I used Natural language processing techniques to scrap “Indeed” website and saved several information of each opening data scientist and data analysis positions in big cites as a data frame. Then, I used python and panda  commands to clean and organize the data frame. At the end, I used machine learning algorithms to predict the salary for data scientist and data analyst positions in large cities including NY, DC, SF did the analysis to figure out the important phrase that increase the salary.

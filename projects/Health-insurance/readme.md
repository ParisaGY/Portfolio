##  Health Insturance Market Analysis

In this project, I worked on several big and unclean dataset (~2 GB) that were originally prepared and released by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). I used different cleaning methods on Amazon Web server (AWS) platform and prepared the clean panda version data. Then, I used Tableau data visualization, different python libraries like numpy, seaborn and matplolib to explore data. At the end, I used several regression and classification models to predict the individual rate, couple rate and smoker rate for 2017 based on data provided for 2014-2016.
